## Setting Up a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Follow these steps to set up a virtual environment:

1. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
```bash
deactivate
```
